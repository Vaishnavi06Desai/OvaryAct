                Although menstruation is a <span style = "color: rgb(208, 178, 241)">natural process</span>, it is barely talked about in society as it is considered taboo.
                <span style = "color: rgb(194, 59, 35)">Millions of people</span> go through this process, being completely <span style = "color: rgb(3, 192, 60)">unaware</span> of what is going on in their bodies.
                This can often lead to <span style = "color: rgb(243, 154, 39)">disorders and diseases</span>, if not managed.
                Menstruation is still not a <span style = "color: rgb(87, 154, 190)">gender-neutral</span> discussion and not a lot of <span style = "color: rgb(208, 178, 241)">queer spaces</span> are available to discuss the same.
                To make the world more <span style = "color: rgb(243, 154, 39)">aware and inclusive</span>, menstrual health and awareness are <span style = "color: rgb(151, 110, 215)">highly important.</span>
